# rechelp

Recruitment Helper made in TypeScript, for a 100commitow.pl contest. The idea of the app is to help the recruiter manage many candidates and their tasks.
The idea was born when I myself struggled with filtering candidates and managing the tasks for each candidate. Today only change in readme as next feature is in state impossible to commit.
